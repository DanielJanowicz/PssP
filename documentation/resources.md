# Resources:

Here are the resources I used in order to assist with the development of this repo.

I used this [repo](https://github.com/hantswilliams/HHA-504-2022/tree/main/Part6_CRUD) by Hants Williams to develop the CRUD python logic for the frontend.

I used another [repo](https://github.com/hantswilliams/HHA-504-2022/tree/main/Part5_DBs) by Hants Williams to develop the SQL server and utilize SQLalchemy.

I also utilized [MYSQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) for database management and visualization.
